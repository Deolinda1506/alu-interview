# Rainwater Trapping

## Description

This project contains a Python function `rain` that calculates how many square units of water will be retained after it rains given a list of non-negative integers representing the heights of walls with unit width 1. The function simulates viewing the cross-section of a relief map and computes the total amount of water trapped between the walls.
